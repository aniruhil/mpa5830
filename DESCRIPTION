Description: This is a binder developed for MPA 5830, an
    introductory course in data analysis and visualization with R we
    require for one of the MPA specialization tracks in our online MPA
    program. Students have only had an Excel course in basic stats prior
    to joing 5830 so the fear factor is tremendous. Using the binder
    should, I hope, eliminate the chaose and heartburn that coems with
    managing packages and local installs of R and RStudio. Praise be!!
